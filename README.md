This is a project with aim of improve the productivity in my daily work. Thanks to [sofa](https://github.com/dadez/sofa) (kudos to
[f4z3r](https://github.com/f4z3r/)), I have great path to open a link or run a command.

The goal here is to iterate over a list of targets like clusters for run command, e.g. open an html webpage.

## todo

- [ ] read cluster list from a remote path or url
- [ ] add util for update cluster list from source
- [ ] esc goes back, do not close
- [x] allow run custom command (prompt)
- [ ] add tests
